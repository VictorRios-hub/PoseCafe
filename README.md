# PoseCafé

PoseCafé is a collaborative project amongst interns of the Metalab. Based on LivePose, PoseCafé implements a "plug and play" solution for generating a visual display based on the surrounding acoustic and visual environment. 

It uses [LivePose](https://gitlab.com/sat-mtl/tools/livepose), the computer vision tool of the SAT.
